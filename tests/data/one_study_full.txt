General Information on the TrialE.1 Medical condition or disease under investigationE.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Bilateral nasal polyposisE.1.1.1 Medical condition in easily understood language: Bilateral nasal polyposisE.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Diseases [C] - Ear, nose and throat diseases [C09]MedDRA ClassificationE.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:E.1.2 Version: 20.0E.1.2 Level: PTE.1.2 Classification code: 10028756E.1.2 Term: Nasal polypsE.1.2 System Organ Class: 10038738 - Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disordersE.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: NoE.2 Objective of the trialE.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab compared to placebo on a background of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in reducing nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) severity and endoscopic nasal polyposis score (NPS) in patients with bilateral nasal polyposis (NP). In addition for Japan, reduction in computed tomography (CT) scan opacification of the sinuses will be also a coprimary objective.E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: -To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving total symptoms score (TSS).-To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in improving sense of smell.-To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing CT scan opacification of the sinuses (Primary objective for Japan).-To evaluate ability of dupilumab in reducing proportion of patients requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids or NP surgery.-To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on patient reported outcomes and health related quality of life outcome by sinonasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22).-To evaluate efficacy with various regimen.-To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in the subgroups of patients with prior surgery and co-morbid asthma (including non-steroid antiinflammatory drug [NSAID] exacerbated respiratory disease NERD]).-To evaluate the safety of dupilumab in patients with bilateral NP.-To evaluate functional dupilumab concentrations (systemic exposure) and incidence of treatmentemergent anti-drug antibodies.E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: NoE.3 Principal inclusion criteria: -Patients with bilateral sinonasal polyposis that despite prior treatment with systemic corticosteroids (SCS) anytime within the past 2 years; and/or have a medical contraindication/intolerance to SCS, and/or had prior surgery for NP at the screening visit, have:    -An endoscopic bilateral NPS of at least 5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity).    -Ongoing symptoms (for at least 8 weeks before V1) of nasal congestion/ blockage/obstruction with moderate or severe symptom severity (score 2 or 3) at V1 and a weekly average severity of greater than 1 at time of randomization (V2), and another symptom such as loss of smell, rhinorrhea (anterior/posterior).-Signed written informed consent.E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: - Patients <18 years of age.- Patient who has been previously treated in dupilumab studies.- Patient who has taken:     -Biologic therapy/ systemic immunosuppressant to treat inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, etc.) within 2 months before V1 or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.          -Any experimental monoclonal antibody (mAB) within 5 half-lives or within 6 months before V1 if the half-life is unknown.     -Anti-immunoglobulin E therapy (omalizumab) within 130 days prior to V1.     -Patients who are receiving leukotriene antagonists/modifiers at V1 unless they are on acontinuous treatment for at least 30 days prior to V1.- Initiation of allergen immunotherapy within 3 months prior to V1 or a plan to begin therapy or change its dose during the run-in period or the randomized treatment period.- Patients who have undergone any intranasal and/or sinus surgery (including polypectomy) within 6 months before V1.- Patients who have had a sinonasal or sinus surgery changing the lateral wall structure of the nose making impossible the evaluation of NPS.- Patients with conditions/concomitant diseases making them non evaluable at V1 or for the primaryefficacy endpoint such as:          -Antrochoanal polyps,     -Nasal septal deviation that would occlude at least one nostril,     -Acute sinusitis, nasal infection or upper respiratory infection,     -Ongoing rhinitis medicamentosa,     -Allergic granulomatous angiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis),Young’s syndrome, Kartagener’s syndrome or other dyskinetic ciliarysyndromes, concomitant cystic fibrosis,     -Radiologic suspicion, or confirmed invasive or expansive fungal rhinosinusitis.- Patients with nasal cavity malignant tumor and benign tumors (eg, papilloma, blood boil etc.).- Patients with forced expiratory volume (FEV1) 50% or less (of predicted normal).- Patients receiving concomitant treatment prohibited in the study.- Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit.- History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or positive HIV serology at screening.- Positive with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody at the screening visit.- Active chronic or acute infection requiring systemic treatment within 2 weeks before the Baseline visit.- Known or suspected history of immunosuppression.- Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.- Women unwilling to use adequate birth control, if of reproductive potential and sexually active.Note: The information listed above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's potential participation in this clinical trial therefore not all inclusion/ exclusion criteria are listed.E.5 End
